# Shutter Button (Arduino)

What to do with a working battery from a dead Bluetooth keyboard? Why, make an Arduino-based BLE shutter button! Based on the Adafruit [Feather M0 Bluefruit LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995).

## Usage

Download, update for your device (Android vs. Apple use different keys to signal the shutter in their respective camera apps) and compile! 3D print design is on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8BrGocOFZU2).

**Pairing:** Hold the shutter button for 3 seconds while powering on. Connect to "Shutter Button". If at any point there's an issue with pairing, simply start over and unit will wipe the pairing history.
